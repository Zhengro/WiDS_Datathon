    "- Objective: Develop a model to predict if patients received a metastatic cancer diagnosis within 90 days of screening (i.e., `DiagPeriodL90D`) using a unique oncology dataset.\n",
    "- Motivation: \n",
    "    - Metastatic TNBC is considered the most aggressive TNBC and requires most urgent and timely treatment. Unnecessary delays in diagnosis and subsequent treatment can have devastating effects in these difficult cancers. Differences in the wait time to get treatment is a good proxy for disparities in healthcare access.\n",
    "    - The primary goal of building these models is to detect relationships between demographics of the patient with the likelihood of getting timely treatment. The secondary goal is to see if environmental hazards impact proper diagnosis and treatment.  #TODO: check this\n",
    "- Dataset\n",
    "    - Source: Provided by Gilead Sciences, originating from Health Verity and enriched with third-party geo-demographic data and zip code level toxicology data from NASA/Columbia University.\n",
    "    - Content: Information about demographics, diagnosis, treatment options, and insurance for patients diagnosed with breast cancer from 2015-2018.\n",
    "    - Highlighted Features:\n",
    "        - Demographics (e.g., age, gender, race, ...)\n",
    "        - Diagnosis and treatment details (e.g., breast cancer diagnosis code, metastatic cancer diagnosis code, metastatic cancer treatments, ...)\n",
    "        - Insurance information\n",
    "        - Geo (zip-code level) demographic data (e.g, income, education, rent, race, poverty, ...)\n",
    "        - Toxic air quality (zip-code level) data (e.g., Ozone, PM25 and NO2, ...)\n",
    "- Evaluation\n",
    "    - Metric: Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Curve (AUC-ROC).\n",
    "    - Leaderboard:\n",
    "        - During the competition: 51% of the test data.\n",
    "        - Final standings: 49% of the test data.\n",
